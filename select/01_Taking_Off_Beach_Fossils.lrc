[00:34.41] I'm taking off again
[00:37.39] It feels like it's so soon
[00:41.26] Am I excited or am I just so confused?
[01:00.26] 
[00:47.46] My head is numb
[00:49.04] And my hands are tied
[00:50.81] And I can't remember what it's like
[00:54.27] Get out of this place, going through
[00:58.11] I'm taking off and I'm asking where are you?
[01:20.11] 
[01:07.53] Where are you?
[01:14.34] Where are you?
[01:21.35] Where are you?
[01:24.81] I can be found somewhere
[01:36.81] 
[01:42.45] Think of times I used to know you
[01:49.59] Growing up I thought about you
[01:56.33] Trying not to see
[01:59.77] Where are you taking me?
[02:03.36] Holding onto the truth
[02:14.36] 
[02:22.99] Where are you?
[02:29.63] Where are you?
[02:33.37] I can be found somewhere
[02:43.37] Somewhere
[02:46.95] I can be found somewhere
[02:57.07] Somewhere
[03:00.71] I can be found somewhere
